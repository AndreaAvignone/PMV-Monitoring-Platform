*Considering the high price solutions for indoor thermal comfort monitoring, this project proposes a low-cost IoT sensor network (exploiting Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms) for collecting real-time data and evaluating specific thermal comfort indicators (PMV and PPD). The overall architecture was accordingly designed, implementing the hardware setup, the back-end and the Android user interface. Eventually, three distinct platforms were deployed for testing the general system and analyzing the obtained results in different places and seasons, based on collected data and usersâ€™ preferences.*

The software is composed of three main parts:
- Back-end
- Platform and sensor network
- Android Application

## Architecture overview

The following picture represents the project architecture. The system was designed to take into account all the distinct aspects to provide a stand-alone platform. Measurements are retrieved from the hardware platform and then processed by the back-end. The final goal was to provide to users an objective thermal comfort indicator (based on mathematical models) for supporting the knowledge related to environmental conditions. Moreover, the system includes the possibility to retrieve additional information from external API (e.g. weather information).

## Getting Started

The project was mainly developed within a **Python 3** environment. In particular, the back-end was hosted by a **Raspberry Pi 4**.\
Main required elements:
* CherryPy
* MQTT
* InfluxDB
* Grafana
* ngrok

To install the specific requirements:

``
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``

### REST Server

The general architecture is based on the micro-services approach.\ Availabe services are stored into databases and exposed through REST protocol - e.g. broker, profile databases, server -. In particular, for each service, IP, port and basic path to start the service are provided (dictionary).

For each service, the JSON-like configuration file is present under the folder:
> /etc 

Using this file, it is possible to edit the configuration of each back-end, like **IP address** and **Port number**. \
Services present a similar structure. The basic path is */Monitoring-Platform + /specific_service* (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8083/Monitoring-Platform/server, http://127.0.0.1:8081/Monitoring-Platform/profiles). \
Given the educational reason behind the project, each service is expected to be individually launched. The expected command has been reported in each specific folder.

  </p>

**Remark**\
The *service catalog* is crucial to orchestrate the whole system, therefore it must be the first one to run. All the other services will both register to the *service catalog* and retrieve the required information about other entities.\
All the services follow the same command structure. Starting from the *service catalog*:

``
python3 service_catalog.py etc/service_catalog.json
``


### MQTT 
The communication sensor-server is based on the MQTT protocol. In this implementation, the back-end is hosting also the broker. Each sensor publishes its own value and the server *subscriber* retrieves the information. In addition to the real-time values provided to the final user, measurements are stored in a specific historical database (*InfluxDB*).

A similar approach is also employed by the *resource catalog* for notifications and warnings.

### ngrok
To enable tunneling, ngrok (https://ngrok.com) was exploited, with proper configuration.

## Associate a new platform

> *For more information, check the devoted repository concerning the hardware platform kit*

When all services are up, new platforms can be installed. Each platform is composed by a **central HUB**, locally exposed for the REST communication with present rooms. It actually ping the back-end to be added to the catalog. Then, a room can be configured.\

**IMPORTANT**: the idea is that a virtual instance is created from the client (i.e. the mobile application), appended to the *profiles catalog* of the specific platform with:
``
connection_flag=False. 
``

When the physical room is plugged, it retrieves information about *service catalog* from the *central HUB*, then it sends a put request to *profiles catalog*.\
In this way, the server check if there is any room previously created, with *connection_flag equal* to false and a timestamp less than 1 minute. Association is therefore performed. 

Moreover, for each profile, a room counter is set. In fact, room is "blind" also about itself, avoiding needs for any kind of a-priori identification. It just knows the IP address of the central HUB, and the *basic room_ID* it is expected to assume (e.g. room_X). When the association is correclty performed, *profiles service* returns the complete configuration, including the ID based on counter (e.g. room_X2 if it is the second associated room) and name set by client. Room updates its own configuration file so that connected sensors can retrieve all information.

### Sensor network
For the **sensor installation**, main.py script is used, independently on the sensor. In fact, when main script is run, it automatically imports the class according to sensor_ID. Sensor_ID is specified as argument, toghether with the room configuration file and the related pin:
```
python3 main.py room_setup.json dht11 17 
```

Again, the sensor requests configuration drivers from *central HUB* with a GET request. If central HUB has not already the drivers inside its own memory, it contacts the **drivers service** to download. Sensor can now be configured, publishing on the broker messages. Eventually, subscriber collects information among all sensors and continusoly updates stored information inside the *server catalog*.
